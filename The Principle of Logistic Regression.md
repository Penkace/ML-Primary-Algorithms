### 1. The Connection And Distinction Between Logistic Regression and Linear Regression
[References](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_537ed51201019gu1.html)<br>
1. LR requires that variables follow normal distribution, while logistic regression doesn't require variable distribution.
2. LR requires that the independent variable is a continuous variable, while logistic regression requires the independent variable
is categorical variable.
3. LR requires a linear relationship between independent variables and dependent variables, while logistic regression doesn't.
4. Logistic regression is to analyze the relationship between the probability of taking a certain value of the dependent variable
and the independent variable, while linear regression is to directly analyze the relationship between the independent variale and 
the dependent variable.
Anyway, there're a lot of similarities between logistic regression and linear regression. The big difference is their dependent
variables. Both of them are belong to the same family, which we called generalized linear models.
